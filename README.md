An example UI application created using C#, .NET v8, Windows Forms, and SQL Server 2017. 
This was created as requested in a job interview process. 

The interviewer asked for:

"a couple tables, perhaps one table for Students (ID, name, address, etc.) and one table for Courses (number, credits, day of week, etc.).  
Then create a couple screens to maintain each in table format and another screen to link them together to create a schedule or transcript."

I used the form designer and primarily used the DataGridView visual component, along with .NET's data binding system to power interaction with the Class and Student tables in the User Interface. 

The application is contained within the "CollegeApp/" folder. I also included a file "tables.sql" which contains exported table creation scripts to replicate the tables I used in my SQL Server database.
